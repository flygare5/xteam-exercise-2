# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

We also are in class together and can cordinate rules and meeting times there. 
By creating times to study and work on projects together. 
## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Through proper communication through texting.
By checking git hub and making sure tasks and assignments are being completed. 
By meeting up and getting assignments done together as opposed to working seperately. 
## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
By texting each other and exchanging phone calls. 
By working together and exchanging work on github.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
By cordinating times to meet in advance of the due date. 
By giving us multiple times to meet up before the due date so we don't do it last minute and have an extra meeting time to finish up uncompleted work. 
By helping each other with our tasks and working together on all of the algorithms and aspects of the problem. 
## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
We will make sure to be good communicators so that everyone is clear on when we are meeting up and what is required. 
We will stay ahead of our deadlines and meet in advance to ensure we have enough time to complete assignments. 
We will stay on top of the material in the class to avoid confusion on topics.
